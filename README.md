# Dotfiles

[![Made with √î√ò√±¬¥¬©√Ö in Neovim](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%20in%20Neovim-57A143?style=for-the-badge&logo=neovim&logoColor=white)](https://neovim.io/)

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and development environment setup.

You can find the base Docker image in the `./Dockerfile` and the setup steps in the `./bootstrap.sh` script.

## Bootstrap Instructions

To set up your environment (requires `sudo` if not inside a Docker container), run:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y
apt install -y git

mkdir -p ~/dev/personal
mkdir -p ~/.config

git clone https://github.com/tkachenko0/dotfiles.git ~/dev/personal/dotfiles

chmod +x ~/dev/personal/dotfiles/bootstrap
~/dev/personal/dotfiles/bootstrap
```
